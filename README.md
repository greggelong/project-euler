# project-euler
a place to hold some code inspired by projecteuler.net 

code in python to solve the problems

code in p5js to visualize it in a more creative way.

Some fun with projecteuler.net. The site gives you “a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.” I solved problem one in #python3 and entered the result, which is a 6 digit number, which I am not showing because they request that you don’t share. But in addition to just a text based solution I have also visualized problem 1 using #p5js. The problem: Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. Here multiples of 3 are red, multiples of 5 are blue, multiples of both are purple, and white are not multiples. All this plotted on a grid that varies in size from 30 to 45. I didn’t visualize the sum. I think it makes a nice pattern.
